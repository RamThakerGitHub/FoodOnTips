#Introduction : 
Online ordering system that I am proposing here, greatly simplifies the ordering process for the customer. system presents an interactive and up-to-date menu with all available options in an easy to use manner. Customer can choose one or more items to place an order which will land in the Cart. Customer can choose can view all the order details in the cart before checking out. At the end, customer gets order confirmation details. once the order is placed it is entered in the database and retrieved in pretty much real time. This allows staff to quickly go through the orders as they are received and process all orders efficiently and effectively with minimal delays and confusion.

#What We Used

Front End : JQuery, JavaScript, Bootstrap 3
Back End  : ASP.Net MVC 5.2 , LINQ 
Database  : MS SQL Server - 2014
